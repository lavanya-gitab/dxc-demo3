Test Strategy:Steps(ITDS)


1)Assess Testability :-

    a)operability:4
    b)controllability:5
    c)observability:5
    d)simplicity:3
    e)undestandability:5
    f)suitabilty:5
    g)Stability:5

2)Test Factors : 

     a)Authorization:- Integration Testing
     b)Correctness:- Integration Testing
     c)Access control:- System testing
     d)Reliabilty:- uat
     e)Performance:- system testing
     f)Integrity:- system testing
     g)Continuity of processing:-  post UAT


3)Assess drivers that would influence testing/approach :-


      a)Authorization --->Integration testing --->tester(Quality analyst)/validation/blackbox
      b)Correctness ---> Integration testing --->tester/validation/blackbox/dynamic
      c)Access control ---> system testing --->tester/verification/blackbox
      e)Reliabilty ---> to what extent we trust ---> uat(client/customer)
      f)performance ---> system ---> tester
      g)integrity ---> system testing ---> tester
      h)continuity of processing ---> post UAT---> client



Test plan:


   1)Test item:- Application name
   2)Software risk issues:- Security,performance
   3)Features to be tested(user stories):- Register users,manager and member function,Admin Funtions
   4)Features not to be tested:- new version(which is not a scope)
   5)Approach:- Whitebox,  blackbox(It contains code and UI)
   6)Test deliverables:- source code,Test scenario,test plan,test case,test execution report,test report,defect report
   7)Item pass/fail criteria:- If i find 5 minor bugs,1 major bug,with no critical/shoew stopper in this case (pass)
   8)Suspension&resumption criteria:- Show stooper in application/non-availabilty of resouce/when this is resolved
  9)Responsibility:- project manager,TEST LEAD,TESTER,CUSTOMER
  10)Staffing and testing needs:- Testing needs
  11)Schedule:- 2 weeks
